Anocca is now releasing our internal tool for displaying DNA and protein sequences as an open source library.

There are a few open source sequence viewers out there such as [SeqViz](https://github.com/Lattice-Automation/seqviz) and the [openVectorEditor](https://github.com/TeselaGen/openVectorEditor). 

The things we were looking for in a sequence viewer was:

1. modularity - we don't want a library full of features which we don't use. We want to be able to pick the features we are looking for
2. non-wrapping linear viewer - we like the linear viewer which doesn't wrap but instead supports zoom and pan
3. custom rendering of annotations

The Anocca sequence viewer consists of a set of npm modules named `@anocca/sequence-viewer-*` which allows for modularity. None of the sequence viewer npm modules has any third party dependencies and consists of commonjs and es6 code as well as typescript definitions.

:::note
@anocca/sequence-viewer-app has react-icons, @mui/material, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled and formik as peer dependencies.

See [SequenceViewerApp](/docs/api/sequence-viewer-app.sequenceviewerapp) and [Getting started](/docs/tutorial/get-started)
