We want to be able to pick the features we are looking for\\n2. non-wrapping linear viewer - we like the linear viewer which doesn\'t wrap but instead supports zoom and pan\\n3. custom rendering of annotations\\n\\nThe Anocca sequence viewer consists of a set of npm modules named `@anocca/sequence-viewer-*` which allows for modularity. None of the sequence viewer npm modules has any third party dependencies and consists of commonjs and es6 code as well as typescript definitions.\\n\\n:::note\\n@anocca/sequence-viewer-app has react-icons, @material-ui/core and formik as peer dependencies.\\n\\nSee [SequenceViewerApp](/docs/api/sequence-viewer-app.sequenceviewerapp) and [Getting started](/docs/tutorial/get-started)\\n\\n:::"}]}')}}]);
